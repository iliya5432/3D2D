# 3D Rendering Engine
![demo](ezgif-1-b944cbdcea.gif)
This repository contains a straightforward 3D rendering engine implemented in C++ using the SFML library. To successfully debug or run the code within an editor, it is essential to install and configure SFML with the code editor beforehand. Please be aware that this project is currently incompatible with a Linux environment.
Installation

#### To utilize this rendering engine, follow these steps:

    Install and configure SFML with your preferred code editor.
    Download the SFML library from the official SFML website: SFML Download.

### Project Status
This codebase is a work in progress. Notably, the depth buffer has not been implemented or optimized at this stage. Please consider this while working with the code.
Feel free to contribute or provide feedback to enhance the functionality and robustness of the rendering engine.
