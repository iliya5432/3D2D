# 3D2D
This is a simple 3D rendering engine written in c++ using SFML library.
In order to debug / run the code with an editor YOU HAVE TO INSTALL AND CONFIG SFML WITH THE CODE EDITOR FIRST.
You can download the SFML library from the main SFML website: https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php
This is not yet a finished code since depth buffer is not yet implemented nor optimized.
